# Contributing

In order to keep the styling of Exact app's in place without breaking any application it's prohibit to commit to master directly. If you want to change something in the default Exact styling you should open a new pull request. Your request will be reviewed before it will be merged into the Living Style Guide.

## Prerequisites
1. NodeJS version or higher
1. NPM version or higher
1. A good cup of coffee (that's where great ideas come from right ;-))

## Contributing guidelines
It's very important to stick to these guidelines. Contributions that do not meet these guidelines will not be accepted nor merged into production.

1. All code contributions _must_ have a pull request (PR in short)
1. Every PR must have a reference to an issue in it's title.
    e.g: "#5 Add contributing.md" is correct
        "Add contributing.md" is incorrect
1. All code must be valid i.e must pass the code checks
1. Every PR must have a milestone before merged into production.
1. Every PR must be reviewed by at least one other contributor before merged.
1. After a merge, the branch that has been merged must be deleted.
